# Begin Day 2 Flags

# End Day 2 Flags

# If you stayed up late with Zoomy, debuff your INTEL just a little bit.
# If you went to bed after A320 chastized you, buff your INTEL just a bit.

# Today you walk to school, as your dad believes it builds character, and he's way too busy for you. 
# Depending on your sister, you either walk alone and meet up with someone (depending on your affinity), or you walk alone.

# Typical school day follows, with a question mid-day about lift.
# You eat lunch with your childhood friend, but notice a small girl looking your way
# That's Zoomy, aka CRJ. 
# Depending on your confidence, you might go sit with her. 
# If you do, you chat it up about Land of Last Fantasy. 

# Schoolbell rings, back to class.

# Random roll to see if you're on cleaning duty. If you are, jump to cleaning duty. Store next jump in a variable so we know where to go back to. 
# Cleaning duty is a random roll every day now, to make the game more dynamic.

# You've forgotten your Fluid Dynamics book again and must share with your seat neighbor. This goes about as well as you'd think based on affinity. 
# If you stayed up with Zoomy, random roll to see if you fall asleep in class. 
# Random Roll to see if A340-sensei catches you sleeping or not.
# If you didn't stay up, you get a bonus to your INTEL from listening to the lecture.

# Classtime is over and if you rolled to clean, start that event. 
# Otherwise, you go to the library to gather some materials to start researching for your team. 

# Multiple girls will be at the library afterschool as well. Select which one you want. They may turn you down based on affinity.
# Most will be willing to study with you. Their reactions will differ based on how they perceive you. 

# After studying, you walk home either alone or with someone, based on affinity. 

# You go home to study, as you know there's a quiz the next day. 

# End of Day 2
